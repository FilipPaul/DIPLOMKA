Inserted fixture part number "44200S" into the fixture object file.
   The fixture part number was selected based on the fixture parameters
   specified.  If you wish to use an alternative fixture part number, please
   list the fixture object and replace the fixture part number in the fixture
   file with one of the other recognized part numbers described in the manual.

 
Trying to use the placement entered into the board_xy file by the user.

The selected board placement will not be compatible
   with the automatic board handler.
 (WARNING BPL44)

Board "1793_1796%1" has potential locations that are outside the probable area
   of the fixture.   Subsequent fixture software may have no alternative
   but to use some of these locations for probing to insure access to
   all nodes.  Selecting a new board placement could eliminate this
   problem. (WARNING BPL85)

Tooling pin (1181,29724) on board "1793_1796%1" is outside the probable area
   of the fixture.  Placing tooling pins in this region of the fixture is
   not recommended.  Selecting a new board placement could eliminate this
   problem. (WARNING BPL86)

Board "1793_1796%2" has potential locations that are outside the probable area

     Module Pin Assignment was run at the standard experience level.
 
Remote sense measurement for Node 1%L1 on Board 1793_1796 
would be improved with a second probe.  Only one probe for this 
node was found in the fixture. Two probes are required to separate 
signal from sense. (WARNING MPA425)

Remote sense measurement for Node 1%L3 on Board 1793_1796 
would be improved with a second probe.  Only one probe for this
