tests involving this node will not work properly. 
Brcs will be assigned but short wires cannot be guaranteed 
for this node. (WARNING MPA403)

     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 1.737.
            The standard deviation is 1.644.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 304 interface pins for 218 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.717.
 
            The wirelist references 264 interface pins on pin cards.

     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 1.750.
            The standard deviation is 1.632.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 306 interface pins for 220 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.719.
 
            The wirelist references 266 interface pins on pin cards.

            The standard deviation is 1.632.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 302 interface pins for 220 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.728.
 
            The wirelist references 266 interface pins on pin cards.

        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 1.750.
            The standard deviation is 1.632.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 302 interface pins for 220 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.728.
 
            The wirelist references 266 interface pins on pin cards.
